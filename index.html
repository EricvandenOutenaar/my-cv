                    I am a former journalist working on a career change - a deep dive into the fascinating world of coding. Currently, I am
                    following a two-year higher professional education in software development.
                    As a person, I am curious, driven and down-to-earth. Interested in getting to know possible future employers.

                <h3>Correspondent Scandinavia, De Volkskrant</h3>
                <h4>Tranås, Sept. 2017 - Sept. 2019 </h4>
                <p> 
                    I worked as the Scandinavian correspondent for the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant. In this
                    position, I wrote articles about news and trends in Sweden. In addition, I traveled regularly to
                    Finland, Denmark and Norway in order to write feature articles. Apart from good interviewing
                    and writing skills, this job involved strong research and planning capacities.

                <h4>Tranås, March 2018 - June 2019  </h4>
                <p> 
                    Once per week, I gave Dutch lessons to children between the age of 7 and 12.

                <h4>Amsterdam, May 2014 - Aug. 2017 </h4>
                <p>
                    This was an exciting job at one of the Netherlands’ most well-known, daily newspapers. At this job
                    you really needed to be able to manage strict deadlines and cooperate with colleagues under
                    pressure. I also further developed my research, interview and writing skills during this job.

                <h4> Amsterdam, Feb 2010 - April 2014</h4>
                <p> 
                    During these years, I gained experience in online journalism for a business news outlet. On a
                    day-to-day basis, I helped managing the content of a business website for entrepreneurs and
                    contributed with news articles to a website for managers. I learned how to write for the web,
                    but was also able to write more in-depth print articles. In 2013, I was for example able to
                    interview world famous tech entrepreneur Elon Musk
                    (Tesla) in Silicon Valley, something I am proud of.

                <p>
                    After my studies in history, I wanted to try out something different. I found a job as 
                    a consultant for a company that sends out personnel to insurance agencies and pension
                    funds. During this period, I gained a lot of practical knowledge, like working with numbers in
                    Microsoft Excel and working in project teams. This was enjoyable, but at some point, I felt that I wanted to
                    explore life as a journalist.
