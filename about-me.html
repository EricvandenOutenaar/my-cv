<article id="about-me">     
    <p> In 2017, I moved with my (Swedish) girlfriend and our daughter 
        from the Netherlands to Sweden. We live in the small town of Tranås, bordering the beautiful lake Sommen, in the highlands of Småland. I have a background in journalism and 
        I initially worked as a correspondent for a Dutch newspaper. This was an interesting job, but I also started to think about a possible career change. Living in a new country inspired me to 
        try something totally different than what I was used to.

        <h3>New adventure</h3>
    <p>
        I heard about the shortage of programmers in Sweden in the coming years and about the oppurtunities in the IT-sector. This made me curious. As an economic journalist, I interviewed
        a lot of tech entrepreneurs. Therefore, I wasn't completely unfamiliar with the IT-world.
        I tried programming by taking several Komvux courses and I soon found out I really liked it. Shortly after that, I enrolled for a two-year education in programming at TUC Yrkeshögskola in Linköping (Systemutvecklare.net).
        What really draws me towards programming is the problem solving aspect of it and the fact that you build applications that people can use. It is satisfying to get an app up and running 
        and to try to make the user experience as smooth as possible.
